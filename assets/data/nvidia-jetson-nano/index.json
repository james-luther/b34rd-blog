For $99 this is an SBC that is priced between the Raspberry Pi and the Latte Panda with performance in line with pricing. I look at this personally as a Raspberry Pi with a better GPU that can be used for all sorts of extra tasks. It's advertised to be an AI device for embedded designers and researchers. I would love to see an OpenCL ICD. With that this device can be used to drop in a location, or even carry in a backpack while visiting a site and we can set it up to grab wifi handshakes and use cuda acceleration with pyrit to crack WPA2. We could also potentially cluster the devices together and use them as a lower power hashcat/machine learning setup, still in a backpack. There is a lot of potential here. Hopefully it delivers.</p>\n","description":"Thoughts on the upcoming NVIDIA Jetson Nano","timeToRead":2,"cover":"https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/jetson-nano-family-press-image-hd.jpg","author":{"id":"b34rd","title":"b34rd","path":"/author/b34rd/"},"tags":[{"id":"single board computer","title":"single board computer","path":"/tag/single%20board%20computer/"},{"id":"hashcat","title":"hashcat","path":"/tag/hashcat/"}]}},"context":{}}
