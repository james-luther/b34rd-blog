Once the system was up and running my kids didn’t give me any time to run benchmarks, change settings, or really have fun with the overclocking. I’ve finally finished everything and have numbers!</p>\n<p>I went a bit wild to start. I set the clock speed on GPU (EVGA GeForce GTX 1080Ti Founders Edition) to 2 GHz and set the power consumption and memory as fast as it would go. This paired with the 4.3 GHz (Ryzen 7 2700X) on all cores of CPU things were rocking at 4k! My kids play mostly Lego games and some emulated games so things were running stable and at great temps! As I’m sure you all guessed, when I finally had a chance to hop on Far Cry 5 things tanked, and they tanked HARD.</p>\n<p>After the crash, I sat down and really thought about what I wanted to achieve. This system sits in an entertainment center with minimal airflow. It only has one 240mm radiator for both the CPU and GPU. I really shouldn’t be pushing it to the limit. The previous iteration at least had an additional 120mm radiator to help out and I added the 1080 Ti to replace the fried 1080 which only increased thermals. After thinking long and hard about what my goals were, I decided. I’m pushing it as far as I can without noise or heat being obnoxious. Here’s how I did…</p>\n<p>CPU — 4.3 GHz on all cores. I could honestly go further but I think that’s a good spot to be for now. Maybe in the future, I can see about a bit more (I can probably get to 4.5 but with the entertainment center I don’t know).</p>\n<p>GPU — Base clock is at 1780 MHz and boost clock is at 2000 MHz. Memory is clocked at 5000 MHz.</p>\n<p>RAM — I was able to crank quite a bit out of RAM, it went from 3200 up to 4400 without any trial and error. I just set the base multiplier and it took it right away.</p>\n<p>After all of this, gameplay max thermals are the high 60s. I’m completely amazed by the ability of the aluminum water cooking kits from EK. Mini ITX is notoriously bad for case airflow, and the Fractal Design Node 500 is a great case but with everything I have packed inside airflow is certainly not the best.</p>\n<p>I was going to post benchmarks and do a full video as well but unfortunately, I haven’t had the time recently. If there is interest, I can do a follow up with benchmarks and further info.</p>\n","excerpt":"It has been a while since I did part 1.

Remove the original cooler mounts from the motherboard, install EK mounts for the aluminum block, install processor and RAM, then install the motherboard into the case. Don’t forget to put the IO shield in first! Next, we install the water block on the graphics card. After installing the card into the case we need to plan out the runs and get the cooling installed. Yes, you can do custom loops in this case. You need the vertical mount to install the pump/reservoir combo outside the case on the rear fan mounts. I use a dremel to remove some of the metal on the vent from the GPU blower and route my tubing through there.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*yee5sXIDH1d-P3AST2vUtg.jpeg\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"tubing through gpu vent\"></p>\n<p>Once we have everything set up, the loop all ready, and the system booting, it is time to decide on OS. My preference was to use Arch but with the gaming for the kids, I think Windows 10 is the best choice (this is only because I don’t want to have to test Steam Play or DXVK for every game they want to play… caveat: I think this is likely the best choice in the near future). For the HTPC part, I went with Kodi. I installed PlexKodiConnect, and wrote a few custom scripts to run Sling as well as a few other simple apps that don’t yet have plugins (these will be on my github page github.com/captainhooligan). For their games, I have the Steam Plugin as well as the BigBox plugin. Launchbox is amazing if you want to set up a gaming PC that is connected to your TV. You can set it to run on boot and everything is seamless! For the emulation, there is nothing better than RetroArch. It covers most of the consoles we are playing minus PS2, PS3, and Wii U. For those, I went with RPCS3 for PS3, PCSX2 for PS2, and Dolphin for Wii U. I didn’t work too hard at getting the dolphin core in RetroArch to run Wii U games, but I’m sure it can be done. The external dolphin emulator works great and can easily be integrated into LaunchBox. There are some tweaks that need to be done for each one and the community forums for each are very well documented.</p>\n<p>Notes: The EK 240G is an amazing product! For the price, there is absolutely no reason to not include it in any build.</p>\n<p>With everything installed and running, it’s time to overclock and test some games!
