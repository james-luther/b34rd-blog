Basically, I was poking around on eBay one day and a 50W CO2 laser showed up. I looked around for one at a decent price that was within the budget I was willing to spend and failed. What I did find in my budget were parts. After they all arrived I put everything together and had a laser engraver minus the controller board. A quick Amazon search led me to RuiDa. It was cheap and worked for what I had. Getting this running was simple. I installed a Virtual Box instance of Windows 10, installed the software, and went about my business. Until …</p>\n<p>My VM died!! Really, the entire hard disk failed and I had no backup. I rebuilt and decided to run in Linux instead of dealing with any virtual machines this time around. That was a little over a year ago. I’ve since rebuilt again (this time I had backups) and went with Manjaro as the OS of choice. Installing RDLaserWorks in Linux is a breeze with wine. On all distros, it’s pretty much the same minus a few different packages. If someone wants a how-to for a specific distro, I will gladly try to help you out.</p>\n<p>Let’s get started!</p>\n<p>First we need to install the required packages.</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #24292eff\">sudo pacman -S wine-staging-nine wine-mono wine_gecko winetricks</span></span></code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*tSPBSZ-aCy0jreF66cEbaQ.png\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"installation via pacman\"></p>\n<p>This only takes a minute depending on your network connection. Once finished we run</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #24292eff\">winetricks</span></span></code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*b17-9JuXd_ezzlzwsApkrQ.png\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"winetricks\"></p>\n<p>We need to select the wineprefix we wish to use and install some resources. The specific ones we need are <pre class=\"shiki\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #24292eff\">cmd, mfc42, and vcrun6</span></span></code></pre>. Once selected and installed we can exit winetricks and begin the installation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Mq8D2Xru9u128qDbawluZw.png\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"install dll or component\">\n<br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*dPzkC8GxSYFjv9EP7vN77A.png\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"cmd\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*3jPOZGai1DdjY-RU3lO36w.png\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"mfc42\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*8xncj5b4Rn7-WQaae0EFhA.png\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"vcrun6\"></p>\n<p>From here we can find our copy of RDLaserWorks and install. If you don’t have this software, you can download directly from RuiDA here: Ruida Downloads. There you select the version you wish to use.</p>\n<p>To install:</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #24292eff\">wine /path/to/installer.exe</span></span></code></pre>\n<p>Follow the prompts of the installer just like you would on Windows.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*pbPszyCQacJMqC2ZA6tVLw.png\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"wizard\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*1jiZlO2s1eGzEV7YUxrqzg.png\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"installation\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/305/1*aUixCgtSioPS3do3vhdoFA.png\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"usb driver\"></p>\n<p>Don’t install the USB driver. Just click the install button and upon completion click exit. You’re finished! On the RuiDa controller specify an IP address and connect it to a switch or an access point. Open up RDWorks, connect to your controller and get to engraving/cutting!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*56vRUk28Lx-eeC-Qi_62Jw.png\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"RDWorks\"></p>\n<p>Oh, you will need to do some configuration, but, it’s no different than on Windows.</p>\n<p>If you’re interested in a laser engraver but don’t want to deal with shopping for parts, Amazon is a great place.
