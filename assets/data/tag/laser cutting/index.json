After doing a bit of research I didn’t see a reason not to other than the fact the aluminum blocks aren’t as pretty with them compared to the nickel blocks. Maybe it’s because of UV lights effect on galvanic corrosion. I need to find out about the second one. I decided to give it a go!</p>\n<p>For those who don’t know what galvanic corrosion is and why it is something important to think about when using aluminum, here are some links:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvanic_corrosion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvanic_corrosion</a>\n<a href=\"https://galvanizeit.org/design-and-fabrication/design-considerations/dissimilar-metals-in-contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://galvanizeit.org/design-and-fabrication/design-considerations/dissimilar-metals-in-contact</a></p>\n<p>From the links in the rabbit hole I fell through, I saw some data suggesting UV light would accelerate things but I had to test it out for myself. My thoughts are if in a case, with indirect sunlight what happens?</p>\n<p>First things first, I had to ensure my laser was functioning. I had a few hiccups along the way, I didn’t have the software installed, once I did get it installed I found the laser had a damaged lens, and finally, after replacing, I had to re-zero and re-calibrate the laser. Once all was done, I got to designing the acrylic.</p>\n<p>The acrylic wasn’t difficult at all to plan out. I just took the current block and some calipers and began measuring. Once all my references were documented I began drawing out the rectangle and screw holes. It took me maybe an hour or so to finish and refine all measurements for cutting. The laser was prepped and cutting began!\n<br></p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uARsiJgUioc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<br>\nThe cut came out nearly perfect! I was off 0.5 millimeters on two screw holes that I fixed quickly in the cut file. They weren’t off enough to prevent screws from threading and tightening, it was off just enough to make my perfectionist nature upset and force me to change it.\n<p>Installing was a breeze, even with the two holes that were off slightly. Everything connected up perfectly!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/500/1*xQHw-JytLCA1_SohFX1mYA.jpeg\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"cut sheet\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/500/1*DTLnTpmCTwStgAYFV0yEkQ.jpeg\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"on gpu block\"></p>\n<p>From here it was time to setup and plumb everything. The test bed is as follows: EK-AC GeForce GTX water block, EK-XRes Revo D5 pump/res combo, EK Cryofuel premix in clear, the custom cut acrylic, and flexible tubing. Temperature is climate controlled at 75 F with 56% humidity. The card is not functioning due to lightning damage and that suits this testing in case anything were to go wrong. Heat will be applied from controlled source at controlled times and for controlled duration.</p>\n<p>So far so good and after weeks of testing, all temperatures have been consistent with before and there has been zero warping, leaks, or anything with the acrylic. </p>\n","excerpt":"I was pondering the other day while pricing out parts for a new build about EK’s aluminum line and questioned to myself “Why don’t they have acrylic sides?”.

Basically, I was poking around on eBay one day and a 50W CO2 laser showed up. I looked around for one at a decent price that was within the budget I was willing to spend and failed. What I did find in my budget were parts. After they all arrived I put everything together and had a laser engraver minus the controller board. A quick Amazon search led me to RuiDa. It was cheap and worked for what I had. Getting this running was simple. I installed a Virtual Box instance of Windows 10, installed the software, and went about my business. Until …</p>\n<p>My VM died!! Really, the entire hard disk failed and I had no backup. I rebuilt and decided to run in Linux instead of dealing with any virtual machines this time around. That was a little over a year ago. I’ve since rebuilt again (this time I had backups) and went with Manjaro as the OS of choice. Installing RDLaserWorks in Linux is a breeze with wine. On all distros, it’s pretty much the same minus a few different packages. If someone wants a how-to for a specific distro, I will gladly try to help you out.</p>\n<p>Let’s get started!</p>\n<p>First we need to install the required packages.</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #24292eff\">sudo pacman -S wine-staging-nine wine-mono wine_gecko winetricks</span></span></code></pre>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*tSPBSZ-aCy0jreF66cEbaQ.png\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"installation via pacman\"></p>\n<p>This only takes a minute depending on your network connection.

The specific ones we need are <pre class=\"shiki\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #24292eff\">cmd, mfc42, and vcrun6</span></span></code></pre>. Once selected and installed we can exit winetricks and begin the installation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Mq8D2Xru9u128qDbawluZw.png\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"install dll or component\">\n<br></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*dPzkC8GxSYFjv9EP7vN77A.png\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"cmd\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*3jPOZGai1DdjY-RU3lO36w.png\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"mfc42\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*8xncj5b4Rn7-WQaae0EFhA.png\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"vcrun6\"></p>\n<p>From here we can find our copy of RDLaserWorks and install. If you don’t have this software, you can download directly from RuiDA here: Ruida Downloads. There you select the version you wish to use.</p>\n<p>To install:</p>\n<pre class=\"shiki\" style=\"background-color: #ffffff\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"color: #24292eff\">wine /path/to/installer.exe</span></span></code></pre>\n<p>Follow the prompts of the installer just like you would on Windows.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*pbPszyCQacJMqC2ZA6tVLw.png\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"wizard\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*1jiZlO2s1eGzEV7YUxrqzg.png\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"installation\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/305/1*aUixCgtSioPS3do3vhdoFA.png\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"usb driver\"></p>\n<p>Don’t install the USB driver. Just click the install button and upon completion click exit. You’re finished! On the RuiDa controller specify an IP address and connect it to a switch or an access point. Open up RDWorks, connect to your controller and get to engraving/cutting!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*56vRUk28Lx-eeC-Qi_62Jw.png\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"RDWorks\"></p>\n<p>Oh, you will need to do some configuration, but, it’s no different than on Windows.</p>\n<p>If you’re interested in a laser engraver but don’t want to deal with shopping for parts, Amazon is a great place.
