After doing a bit of research I didn’t see a reason not to other than the fact the aluminum blocks aren’t as pretty with them compared to the nickel blocks. Maybe it’s because of UV lights effect on galvanic corrosion. I need to find out about the second one. I decided to give it a go!</p>\n<p>For those who don’t know what galvanic corrosion is and why it is something important to think about when using aluminum, here are some links:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvanic_corrosion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvanic_corrosion</a>\n<a href=\"https://galvanizeit.org/design-and-fabrication/design-considerations/dissimilar-metals-in-contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://galvanizeit.org/design-and-fabrication/design-considerations/dissimilar-metals-in-contact</a></p>\n<p>From the links in the rabbit hole I fell through, I saw some data suggesting UV light would accelerate things but I had to test it out for myself. My thoughts are if in a case, with indirect sunlight what happens?</p>\n<p>First things first, I had to ensure my laser was functioning. I had a few hiccups along the way, I didn’t have the software installed, once I did get it installed I found the laser had a damaged lens, and finally, after replacing, I had to re-zero and re-calibrate the laser. Once all was done, I got to designing the acrylic.</p>\n<p>The acrylic wasn’t difficult at all to plan out. I just took the current block and some calipers and began measuring. Once all my references were documented I began drawing out the rectangle and screw holes. It took me maybe an hour or so to finish and refine all measurements for cutting. The laser was prepped and cutting began!\n<br></p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uARsiJgUioc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<br>\nThe cut came out nearly perfect! I was off 0.5 millimeters on two screw holes that I fixed quickly in the cut file. They weren’t off enough to prevent screws from threading and tightening, it was off just enough to make my perfectionist nature upset and force me to change it.\n<p>Installing was a breeze, even with the two holes that were off slightly. Everything connected up perfectly!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/500/1*xQHw-JytLCA1_SohFX1mYA.jpeg\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"cut sheet\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/500/1*DTLnTpmCTwStgAYFV0yEkQ.jpeg\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"on gpu block\"></p>\n<p>From here it was time to setup and plumb everything. The test bed is as follows: EK-AC GeForce GTX water block, EK-XRes Revo D5 pump/res combo, EK Cryofuel premix in clear, the custom cut acrylic, and flexible tubing. Temperature is climate controlled at 75 F with 56% humidity. The card is not functioning due to lightning damage and that suits this testing in case anything were to go wrong. Heat will be applied from controlled source at controlled times and for controlled duration.</p>\n<p>So far so good and after weeks of testing, all temperatures have been consistent with before and there has been zero warping, leaks, or anything with the acrylic. </p>\n","excerpt":"I was pondering the other day while pricing out parts for a new build about EK’s aluminum line and questioned to myself “Why don’t they have acrylic sides?”.

Remove the original cooler mounts from the motherboard, install EK mounts for the aluminum block, install processor and RAM, then install the motherboard into the case. Don’t forget to put the IO shield in first! Next, we install the water block on the graphics card. After installing the card into the case we need to plan out the runs and get the cooling installed. Yes, you can do custom loops in this case. You need the vertical mount to install the pump/reservoir combo outside the case on the rear fan mounts. I use a dremel to remove some of the metal on the vent from the GPU blower and route my tubing through there.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*yee5sXIDH1d-P3AST2vUtg.jpeg\" alt=\"alt text\" title=\"tubing through gpu vent\"></p>\n<p>Once we have everything set up, the loop all ready, and the system booting, it is time to decide on OS. My preference was to use Arch but with the gaming for the kids, I think Windows 10 is the best choice (this is only because I don’t want to have to test Steam Play or DXVK for every game they want to play… caveat: I think this is likely the best choice in the near future). For the HTPC part, I went with Kodi. I installed PlexKodiConnect, and wrote a few custom scripts to run Sling as well as a few other simple apps that don’t yet have plugins (these will be on my github page github.com/captainhooligan). For their games, I have the Steam Plugin as well as the BigBox plugin. Launchbox is amazing if you want to set up a gaming PC that is connected to your TV. You can set it to run on boot and everything is seamless! For the emulation, there is nothing better than RetroArch. It covers most of the consoles we are playing minus PS2, PS3, and Wii U. For those, I went with RPCS3 for PS3, PCSX2 for PS2, and Dolphin for Wii U. I didn’t work too hard at getting the dolphin core in RetroArch to run Wii U games, but I’m sure it can be done. The external dolphin emulator works great and can easily be integrated into LaunchBox. There are some tweaks that need to be done for each one and the community forums for each are very well documented.</p>\n<p>Notes: The EK 240G is an amazing product! For the price, there is absolutely no reason to not include it in any build.</p>\n<p>With everything installed and running, it’s time to overclock and test some games!
